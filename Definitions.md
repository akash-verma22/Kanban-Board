# WEB DEVELOPMENT BACKEND NOTES

## 1. <b>What is Node.js? </b>
    
Node.js is a runtime environment that lets you run JavaScript code outside the browser, typically on a server.
It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, making it fast and efficient.

## Key features

-   Event-driven & non-blocking I/O(handles many connections efficiently)

-   Single-threaded, but can handle concurrent operations using an event loop

-   Uses npm (Node Package Manager) for     installing third-party packages

## Interview Tip
Node.js allows building scalable network applications. It's non-blocking, event-driven nature makes it ideal for I/O-heavy tasks like real-time apps (e.g., chat, streaming).

## 2. <b>What is Express.js? </b>

Express (or Express.js) is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that helps you build web servers and APIs easily.

It provides a layer on top of Node.js to simplify common tasks like:

- Routing (handling different URL paths)

- Middleware (processing requests before sending responses)

- Handling form data, JSON, cookies, etc.

## 3. <b>What are Environment Variables? </b>

Environment variables are key-value pairs set outside your source code, typically at the OS or deployment environment level, that define configuration settings for your application.

They let you write code that adapts to different environments (development, testing, production) without changing the actual code.
